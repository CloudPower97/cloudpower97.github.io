description: The Remote HSM project leverages PKCS#11 to enable secure remote access to multiple HSMs, allowing centralized management of cryptographic services. It consists of an OpenAPI for RESTful API interaction, a Native PKCS#11 DLL for client-side integration, a Proxy DLL that translates requests, and a WebService that performs cryptographic operations on HSMs. The system provides seamless interaction between applications and HSMs, ensuring security and flexibility.
